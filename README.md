## ü§ñ Autonomous Capabilities

Our robot‚Äôs intelligence is built on a robust, modular codebase, enabling it to interpret and react to its surroundings with high accuracy and reliability.

### Navigation & Sensing
- **Line Following & Junction Detection:** Tracks both solid and colored lines, recognizes junctions for grid-based navigation.
- **Dotted Line Following:** Advanced tracking for segmented paths.
- **Obstacle Detection:** Proactively avoids obstacles using real-time sensor data.
- **Ramp Navigation:** Detects inclines (e.g., 20-degree ramp) and dynamically adjusts speed for safe traversal.

### Sensing & Control Systems
- **Color-Based Classification:** Detects and sorts ping-pong balls by color using calibrated sensors.
- **Barcode Reading:** IR sensor-based barcode detection for environmental awareness.
- **Encoder PID Control:** Maintains precise straight-line movement using PID algorithms and high-resolution encoders.

### Manipulation Tasks
- **Precise Object Handling:** Picks and places balls and boxes with accuracy.
- **Automated Sorting:** Stores classified objects in dedicated compartments.

## üß† Robust Code Architecture

Our software is designed for reliability, flexibility, and real-time performance.

### Reliability Features
- **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Detects hardware faults, sensor anomalies, and recovers gracefully from unexpected events.
- **Fail-Safe Routines:** Watchdog timers and safety interlocks ensure safe operation at all times.

### Modularity & Extensibility
- **Task-Based Modules:** Each competition objective is encapsulated for rapid adaptation before/during the event.
- **Subsystem Abstraction:** Independent modules for locomotion, manipulation, and sensing allow parallel development and debugging.

### Real-Time Decision Making
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Asynchronous event loops respond instantly to environmental changes and judge commands.
- **Subsystem Communication:** Efficient message passing coordinates the arm, drive system, and sensors for multi-step tasks.

## üèÜ Competition Journey

The SLRC 2025 finals presented us with eight distinct objectives to be completed within a tight 30-minute window. Our robot excelled in:

1. **Ping-Pong Ball Collection:** Grabbing balls from cylindrical components in a grid.
2. **Color-Based Classification:** Sorting balls by color with high sensor precision.
3. **Muddy Region Navigation:** Maneuvering through tough terrain and obstacles.
4. **Ramp Ascent & Descent:** Traversing steep ramps with robust control.
5. **Confined Passage Navigation:** Precise steering through narrow, walled passages.

Our seamless transitions between environments and complex multi-step execution propelled us to the top five.
